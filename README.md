# Dart-Throwing Monkey on Crypto ðŸª™

This project is a website built with NextJS 13, featuring the newest web development tools and technologies. The website aims to test the theory of the Dart-Throwing Monkey, which suggests that a monkey randomly selecting stocks to invest in can outperform professional investors over a long period of time.

## Theory

The Dart-Throwing Monkey theory is based on the idea that the stock market is unpredictable, and no one can consistently beat the market over a long period of time. Therefore, a monkey randomly throwing darts at a list of stocks has a 50-50 chance of beating a professional investor. The theory was first proposed in the book "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel.
